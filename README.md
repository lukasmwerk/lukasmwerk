Welcome to my Github!

Almost all of my personal work is on an ongoing audio software initiative, where I am currently working on surgical audio pre-processing and sample library organization. A good chunk of that time is also spent building datasets and researching + designing machine learning models for controllable audio generation.

I have a few public mini-projects below that get a little less love.
Jeffoncall is a grocery manager that is designed to track grocery prices and rank pre-uploaded/scraped recipes based on how economic they are in a weekly email.
Yunque is an expansion on some old ecommerce software I worked on, if I could start again with completely different scaling requirements.
bookvocab is a program heavily integrating modelling techniques and parsing to get me vocab lists for books in spanish.

My main toolbox/stack:
C/C++ - all of my large codebase, big app big performance work
Python - data science, engineering and machine learning
Go - my go-to for distributed and little tools
Typescript/JS/HTML/CSS/SCSS - anything web, react and next
Java - organizational and enterprise code, my introduction to programming

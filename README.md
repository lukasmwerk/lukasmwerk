Some side projects I'm working on:
- [Yunque](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - An exploration into scaling ecommerce backends, using a microservice architecture, written in Go and uses some industry-common technologies
- [Klang](https://github.com/atalere-audio/klang) - A core library for my audio 'startup', written in C++
- [Korrero](https://github.com/korrero) - A social media project based on democratizing information and fighting echo chambers, mostly an excuse for me to work on cloud and data skills


- [Personal Skills](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills) - Mostly a backup for notes/docs, but has a [readme](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills/blob/main/README.md) if you want a more detailed view of what I know

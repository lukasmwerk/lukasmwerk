If you want to check out some things I'm currently working on:

- [Yunque](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - An exploration into scaling ecommerce backends, written in Go and using databases such as Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Redis
- [Klang](https://github.com/atalere-audio/klang) - A core library for my audio 'startup', written in C++
- [Korrero](https://github.com/korrero) - A social media project based on democratizing information and fighting echo chambers, mostly an excuse for me to work on cloud and data skills
- [Personal Skills](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - Working on backing up my old paper notes from classes, jobs and personal study in a documentation style format.

If you got here from my resume, unfortunately most of the projects or experiences I've listed are either for clients and jobs or have commercial prospects and aren't public. The projects I've listed above are mostly unrelated, but are also the most up-to-date reflection of how I write code.

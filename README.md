If you want to check out some of the stuff I'm currently working on:

[Yunque](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - An exploration into scaling ecommerce backends, written in Go and using databases such as Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Redis
[Klang](https://github.com/atalere-audio/klang) - A core library for my audio "startup", written in C++
[Korrero](https://github.com/korrero) - A social media platform based on democratizing information and fighting echo chambers and astroturfing, also a vehicle for me to hone different web technologies and skills; projects written in Java, Go, Javascript, Python, C/C++, and feature industry standard technologies like apache kafka.

If you got here from my resume, unfortunately most of the projects or experiences I've listed there are either for clients and jobs or have commercial prospects. However, if you want to see some of my work the projects listed above are just as good to check out.

Some open side projects I'm working on:

- [Grocery Suggestion Service](https://github.com/atalere-audio/klang) - A self-hosted Flask project that builds and emails weekly grocery suggestions based on weekly web-scraped prices, nutrition models, user preferences and more.
- [Online Store](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - An exploration into scaling ecommerce backends, using a microservice architecture, written in Go and uses some industry-common technologies.
- [Social Media Platform](https://github.com/korrero) - A social media project based on democratizing information and fighting echo chambers, mostly an excuse for me to work on cloud and data skills, built with Spring. (Currently studying some repos, designing the architecture)

- [Personal Skills](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills) - Mostly a backup for notes/docs, but has a [readme](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills/blob/main/README.md) with a detailed summary of my skills.

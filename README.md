Welcome to my Github!

Almost all of my personal work is on an ongoing audio software initiative, where I am currently working on surgical audio pre-processing and sample library organization. A good chunk of that time is also spent building datasets and researching + designing machine learning models for controllable audio generation.

Below are some of my publicly available projects, which are less structured and more about investigating some topic or solving some personal problem or need.

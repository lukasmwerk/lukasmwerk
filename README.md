Some side projects I'm working on:
- [Yunque](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/yunque) - (Active) An exploration into scaling ecommerce backends, using a microservice architecture, written in Go and uses some industry-common technologies
- [Klang](https://github.com/atalere-audio/klang) - (Low Prio) A core library for my audio 'startup', written in C++
- [Korrero](https://github.com/korrero) - (Low Prio) A social media project based on democratizing information and fighting echo chambers, mostly an excuse for me to work on cloud and data skills


- [Personal Skills](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills) - Mostly a backup for notes/docs, but has a [readme](https://github.com/lukasmwerk/skills/blob/main/README.md) if you want a more detailed view of what I know

If you're looking for projects I've listed on applications, they are most likely closed-source either for client/class decisions, or in the case of my audio softwareâ€”because it's explicitly profit-driven. I'm doing my best to keep an updated selection (above) of code that anyone can take a look at.
